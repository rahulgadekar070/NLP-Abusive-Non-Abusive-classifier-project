# NLP-Abusive-Non-Abusive-classifier-project
NLP Abusive and Non-Abusive email classifier project with model deployment by flask framework.
Â 
The main objective of the project is to develop an accurate predictive Text Classification Model through the Python language, which determines whether an email-message is Abusive or Non-Abusive. 

In this, we did Data Pre-processing, feature engineering, feature extraction, model building & model deployment by using flask framework.
We use Random Forest Classifier to obtain better results & we got 99.11% Training Accuracy and 98.85% Validation Accuracy.
